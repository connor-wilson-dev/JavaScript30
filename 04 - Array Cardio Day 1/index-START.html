    let fifteen = inventors.filter(inventor => (inventor.year < 1600 && inventor.year  >= 1500))

    /***********************
    Take away from wes' solution:
    the callback function inside of filter only needs to return a true or false, my solution works because it returns a full object which is truthy, and so either will work.

    Wes' is cleanest because it takes advantage of the fact that any boolean statement will return either true or false, letting it be consolidated from an if statement into a simple boolean. This is a little easier to read, and does not require as much head space.

    // Array.prototype.map()
    // 2. Give us an array of the inventors' first and last names
    let firstNameLastName = inventors.map(inventor =>  `${inventor.first} ${inventor.last}`);

    });

    // Wes' Solution
    const ordered = inventors.sort((a,b) => a.year > b.year ? 1 :  -1);

    //console.table(ordered);

    /*****************
    Key Take Aways:
    Wes' solution takes advantage of ternary statements, which will make the code fit on one line. But he uses it to return either 1 or -1. My function which returns a statement is a bit more confusing and is one I don't really understand.

    Wes' solution is great because it can almost be viewed as giving a priority or an index, if a is greater than b than give a +1, else give -1, thus lowering its priority in the sorting method.
    *****************/


    // Array.prototype.reduce()
    // 4. How many years did all the inventors live?
    let inventorAgeTotal = inventors.map(inventor => (inventor.passed - inventor.year)).reduce( (a,b) => a + b, 0);

    //console.table(inventorAgeTotal);

    // Wes' Solution

    const totalYears = inventors.reduce((total, inventor) => {
      return total + (inventor.passed - inventor.year)
    }, 0);

    /************
    Key Take Aways:
    Wes' solution takes full advantage of the reduce method. I had not grasped the meaning of having an accumulator and a currentValue in the MDN docs, and now i understand what is actually available to me.

    In my solution, I thought it would be necessary to first map and calculate the age of each inventor into a new array and then reduce it. But now i can see, thanks to Wes' example, that I can still access that inventor (the currentValue) and mess with that before adding it to the accumulator.  Also important to add a zero at the end of the function so the reduce function knows where to start counting from. This also would save me from manipulating the data, since wes' function leaves it all intact.

    // 5. Sort the inventors by years lived
    let inventorOldestFirst = inventors.map(inventor => {return {inventor: `${inventor.first} ${inventor.last}`, age: inventor.passed - inventor.year}}).sort((a,b) =>  b.age - a.age);

    console.table(inventorOldestFirst);

    // Wes' solution
    const oldest = inventors.sort(function(a,b) {
      const lastGuy = a.passed - a.year;
      const nextGuy = b.passed - b.year;
      return lastGuy > nextGuy ? -1 : 1
    });

    console.table(oldest);
    /*************
    Key Take Aways:
    Here I think Wes' solution is actually not quite right? I think it could just be done simpler. I think he is right to take the ages of either person and set them up in variables that will be easier to understand.

    I like my solution a tad better (though it has its own problems) because it can be fit into one line of code. But looking over my code again, and seeing my results laid out in a table. I can see where wes' is correct. His function is not manipulating the data into something new, it is just simply sorting the data per the functions request, which given how few lines he does it in, is a really clean piece of code.
