    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100, age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = 'Connor';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'Franklin';
    console.log(name,name2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

const team = players
//this turns the fourth person in the array team to lux, but it also manipulates the fourth person of players to be lux too, which can have unintended consequences.
team[3] = 'lux'

console.log(players, team) // both equal [wes,sarah,ryan,lux]
    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
const team2 = players.slice();
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
team2[3] = 'Lux'; // this now turns the fourth person on team 2 to Lux, but leaves Poppy on the players Arrays

//Slice, when given no arguments, makes a copy of an array for you to manipulate and mess with.


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
const team3 = [].concat(players); //works similarly to the one above
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
const team4 = [...players];
  //or create a new array from the players array
const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
const captain = person
captain.number = 99 //this changes person as well as captain, which we don't want
    // how do we take a copy instead?
const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99})
console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
